# I Heard It Through the Grapevine

1.

Claude, Gertie, Winthrop, Camellia, Thaddeus, and Alastair are gathered at Elsie's Bar to discuss Hampton's mental
state. They all pulled up chairs around a large table in the main room.

Claude launched the discussion by asking, "OK, we know what wrong with the boy?"

Thaddeus responded, "Well, he told us he's feeling all out of sorts, but he ain't told us why. And when we try to pin
him down, he gets all squirmy."

Alastair added, "Yeah, he's a crafty dude, always managing to dodge our questions with some pun or what not."

Gertie asked, "Anything we could do to cheer the boy up?"

Alastair said, "He seems excited about the gospel show tonight. He met with the group leader for a while over at the real estate office."

Claude smiled. "The boy always did love him some gospel. Makes me happy to know we'll see him there tonight. Thad, Al,
just make sure he show up, alright?"

Thaddeus responded, "Done, Mr. Claude!"

Then he and Alistair got up, said their goodbyes, and left the bar.

Claude turned to Gertie and told her, "Why don't you get on home and rest? Me and Winthrop here got some business to attend to."

Gertie got up, leaned over, and kissed Claude on the cheek. "See you at home, sugar. And you take care now, Winnie. And
don't you fret about your girl and Hampton. It'll be just fine."

When she had left the bar, Claude said to Winthrop, "Let's get ourselves to the back room. Hampton be here soon."

Winthrop asked Camellia, "Did you bring a book like I told you?"

Camellia reached into her purse and pulled out a small romance novel. "Yes, daddy."

"OK, sit yourself here reading, or even just pretending to read, for all it matters, and Hampton should be along soon."

Camellia nodded, and opened her book.

Claude and Winthrop went into the back, and pulled up two chairs near a small service window, which would allow them to
hear what was going on in the main room. And giving it was only mid-afternoon, and the bar was mostly empty, they
thought that they ought to be able to hear whatever was said between Hampton and Camellia.

Winthrop began two months into a story, but Claude hushed him, saying, "Hampton coming in the front door now. You gotta keep quiet."

Hampton entered singing Blue Oyster Cult's song "Don't Fear the Reaper" in a loud voice. He stops singing when he
notices Camellia sitting at her table.

"Hampton, how you been?"

"Yeah, I been fine."

"You been sending me a whole lotta texts, and I been meaning to respond..."

Hampton cuts her off. "I ain't sent you nothing."

"Whachoo talking bout? You know damn well you been sending me texts. And they was kinda sweet. But now you being mean,
and that sweetness turning kind of sour."

"You honest?"

"Say what?"

"You fair?"

"I have no idea what you getting at."

"I'm just saying, if you honest and fair, then just stop being so beautiful."

"That don't make no sense. Why someone beautiful can't be honest and fair?"

"Cause beauty like you got turns men into liars. I once said I loved you."

"Yeah, that what you made me believe."

"You never should've believed me. Cause I never loved you."

"I sure was fooled."

"Listen, you ought to give up on men, and become one of them church ladies who shakes around and cries on Sundays when
the Holy Spirit grabs ahold of her. Cause otherwise you just gonna be breeding sinners like me."

"Where your daddy at?"

"He home."

"Good. Let that fool stay there." He turned to head toward the exit door, but then paused and looked back to Camellia.

Camellia shoots a worried look back at the service window behind which Claude and her father are ensconced. Her father
lifts up his hand so she can see it and gestures that she should keep pretending they are not there.

"Just don't be with no man. Or if you're gonna have a man pick a really dumb one. Cause the smart ones know you're gonna
be out whoring around with their friends and making fools of them. But better you just become one of them church ladies.
So you take care."

Hampton again began to leave, but again turned back.

"I know about you shine-eye girls: you can't accept the face our Lord done give you, so you gotta go purchase all fancy
crap to put on a fake face. Well, I'm sick of it. I'm done with the whole business."

Hampton turned and walked rapidly out of the bar.

Camellia buried her face in her hands, and began crying softly. "What happened to him?" she said, mostly to herself.

Claude and her father came out of the back room and sat down on either side of her at the table.

Camellia said to them, "I can barely stand to see that boy in such a state. He was the best of Denmark, and now he just like a brokedown palace."

Claude responded, "I don't think it all about you. There something else be troubling that boy. And whatever it is, I suspect it kind of dangerous."
