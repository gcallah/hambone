# I. Up on the Roof

## 1.

Denmark, South Carolina, is a drowsy hamlet almost at the halfway point on the trip from Columbia down
to Savannah. Carolina Highway is the main street through the
town center. At its north end the street boasts a number of elegant, antebellum southern houses,
with covered porches, balconies, wisteria climbing trellises and shading the porch, and crepe myrtles and pindo palms in
the yard.
But by and large the town is in a state of advanced decay. The old downtown's brick buildings are more often empty than
not, and some of them are collapsing. Denmark Furniture, once one of the town's largest businesses, is now a ghost store,
with sheets of tattered brown paper covering its windows. The storefront of Denmark Hardware looks as though the people
who work inside are not familiar with how to use any of the paints or repair tools that they sell.

Only four square miles in area, the town
is inhabited by a few thousand souls.
Most of the residents are poor: the average family income is less than $20,000.
The vast majority of them, almost 90%,
are black folk, but until recently, the leading citizen of the
town was a white businessman, Will Shepherd. He owned the town's only real estate agency, as well as its used car
dealership, and its most popular bar, Elsie's.

But there were rumors, rumors that his real money came from controlling the town's drug supply: mainly weed, coke, and
oxy. So when he died from snorting what was apparently some tainted coke, there were more rumors: maybe he had been
taken out.

Up on the roof of Elsie's on South Magnolia Avenue, seated on metal folding chairs, two young black men,
Bernie and Frankie, contemplated these rumors, while smoking a joint.

Bernie asked, "So you think someone took out ole Will?"

Frankie coughed a little, but managed to squeek out "Sure nuff," without exhaling.

"Who you think did it?"

Finally letting out a cloud of smoke, Frankie said, "Gotta be Forrest's gang. Then been wantin' to move in on Will
for a long time now."

"Them lame-ass mothers from up in Norway?"

(Yes, it is true: a few miles north of Denmark, South Carolina, there is, in fact, another small town named Norway. And
in between the two lies Sweden, and, nearby, Finland. This was apparently a bit of humor on the part of The South
Carolina Railroad Company, which had built the rail line through the area: someone there had thought it funny to name
stops in this hot, humid, and, at that time, malaria-infested country after cold Scandavian lands.)

"Man, it don't make no sense to underestimate them. That Forrest, he mean."

Bernie, staring up at the low-hanging clouds, asked, "Now wait a second: didn't Will kill Forrest's daddy?

"Yeah, that's what some folk say... and they say he killed a whole bunch of Polacks too!"

"What the Polacks doing in Norway?"

"I dunno. Some Polish Mafia shit."

Hearing a noise behind them, they spun around to find two other young black men, Marcus and Hiram,
opening the door onto the roof.

Marcus shook his head. "Man, you boys don't ever wanna share, do you?"

Bernie laughed, and after taking a hit, passed the joint to Marcus, who passed it to Hiram after having his allotment.

Hearing a noise in the street below, Frankie looked over the parapet. "Who dat down there?"

Everyone leaned forward. Below them, a middle-aged white man walked drunkenly past the bar.

Marcus said, "Yo, dat looks like ole Will!"

Bernie replied, "Man, you fool, you know we done buried Will two months ago. You was there!"

Hiram shouted down, "Hey old man, where you comin' from? You from around here?"

The man looked up at the four occupants of the roof, but said nothing, then turned away and continued slowly north on the
street, towards the Amtrak station at the end of the road.

(The station hosts one train per day, at 2:57 AM, and, per Amtrak, features the following inconveniences:  
- Unstaffed station
- ATM not available
- No elevator
- No payphones
- No Amtrak ticketing kiosks
- No restrooms
- Unaccompanied child travel not allowed
- No vending machines
- No WiFi  
)

The man might have been heading to the train, but if so, he was several hours early. But if not to the station, where
else was he going on this deserted street?
Hiram gestured that he was puzzled, and told the others, "Yo, imma go get Hampton. He gotta check this guy out: maybe he a long
lost relative or something."

Meanwhile, downstairs in the bar, Will's brother, Claude, was having a party celebrating his engagement to Will's widow,
Gertie. His fifteen guests were seated at a "table" that was assembled by pushing together five of the card tables that
the bar used for patrons' dining, and covering them with a glossy, red-checked table cloths.

Claude addressed the gathering:

"It looks like Forrest might be planning a takeover of some new turf. And he ain't got no proof,
but he suspects that it was Will that killed his pappy. So we gotta be ready for some action from Norway.

"Therefore, Imma send Corny and Clarence up to Norway to see if they can talk some sense into Forrest."

Claude paused to see if there was any reaction to his announcement. There being none, he
looked over at a young, dreadlocked black man at the other end of the table.

"So Ambrose, I hear you plan on headin' back down Louisiana?"

"Yes sir. Plenty work on them oil rigs."

"And what yo daddy say about this?"

Ambrose's father, Winthrop, seated next to his boy, spoke up: "Yeah, I don't like it, but he talk me into it. So I
guess it fine."

Claude next turned to the unhappy-looking white youth sitting directly across from him.

"Hampton, you know you like a son to me. And we gonna need you if Forrest is making a move against us. I know you're
still mourning yo' daddy, but you gotta snap out of it.

Gertie, from her chair next to Claude, joined in. "Yes son, why you seem so down?"

Hampton rose from his chair, offended. "Whachoo mean 'seem'? You think I'm just putting on some show?"

Claude waved his hands back and forth as though blessing the congregation at a church service.

"Now listen, it only right you mourning your pappy. But boy, enough is enough. You're not the only one who lost his
daddy. You see my daddy anywhere round here? Everyone here gonna lose their daddy sooner or later, if they ain't done so
already. That just the way of things. You upset about that, you gotta take the issue up with our good Lord.
And given our situation, we gotta ask you to drop your intent to go back to Georgia, and stick around here for the present."

(Hampton, who played guitar, had been knocking around the music scene in Athens, trying to get a band going,
but without much success.)

Hampton, while giving a mock bow, answered, "Your wish is my command."

Claude ignored the sarcasm, and with a big grin, told Hampton, "Now that makes me real pleased."

Just then, Hiram entered the bar from the back room, and called Hampton over.

Hampton excused himself from the table, saying "My boy needs me."

Ambrose got up from the party table just after Will did, beckoning his sister Camellia to join him at a table
in the back of the bar. She was a tall, slim young woman. Her hair was worn in a short afro, and colorful tatoos adorned
her arms.

"So I'm going back to Louisiana. You gonna keep texting me while I gone?"

"You know I gonna. But I can't believe you gonna miss my exhibit next week."

"Exhibit?"

"I told you: I'm showing some of my paintings at the library."

"Ah, yeah, I forgot. But I gotta head back. Work calls." Ambrose shrugged, then paused, looking up to the ceiling. He
continued: "And you might not wanna hear this, but I gotta talk to you about Hampton."

"Oh, here we go."

"No, you listen here girl: you know he just messing with you, right? Ain't no white boy from the Shepherd family gonna
get serious with a black girl from the hired help. And even if he was serious, his family ain't gonna let him follow through."

"So you giving me this advice, but I know you messing around with that white girl who work at the golf club... you think
she serious about you?"

"Aw we just having some fun."

"Yeah, so don't be giving me no advice you ain't gonna follow yourself."

Their father, Winthrop, joined them at their table. He spoke to Ambrose:
"Listen my boy, you gonna be making big money down on them oil rigs. Don't you go losing your head cause you got a few
dollars to spend. I know them Louisiana folks all into their fancy French ways, but you gotta remember where you from."

"Daddy, you ain't got nothing to worry about."

Ambrose sighed. "I gotta go get some rest before I leave. And Camellia, don't you forget what I told you."

Ambrose got up from the table and walked out of the bar.

Winthrop asked Camellia, "What was it he told you?"

"He told me I oughta back off from Hampton."

"What going on between you and Hampton?"

"Daddy, he tell me he really wanna be with me, and not, you know..." 

"And you believe him?"

"Why shouldn't I believe him?"

"Camellia, baby, you yound and innocent. You have any idea how many black girls found themselves in a whole world of
trouble 'cause they believed the promises some white boy made them?"

"But daddy, Hampton ain't like that!"

"Yeah, all them girls thought they's Hampton weren't like that neither."

"Daddy..."

"Baby girl, if you love your daddy, you gotta listen to me: when he come around, you jes gotta flat out send him
packin'. No ifs, ands or buts about it. You gonna thank me in the end."

Camellia nodded, unable to field further objections to her father's case against Hampton.

As Hiram and Hampton walked away from the party table, Hiram asked, "Ain't it kind of weird, your uncle gettin' engaged to
your mom so soon after your daddy died?"

Hampton shrugged. "Hey, it's just a cost savin' measure."

"Whachoo mean?"

"There's still a bunch of liquor and blow left over from daddy's funeral, so they can save money by usin' it for the
engagement party."

"Man, you cold."

"Not as cold as somebody plannin' to marry his own brother's widow not two months after his brother been buried."

"OK, you got a point there. But you gotta get a look at this man we seen."

Hiram brought Hampton out of the bar. He looked up and down the street, and spotted the drunk, who had apparently turned
away from the train station and headed down the street in the other direction, just a hundred feet south of them. He
pointed him out to Hampton.

"Brother, that dude look like yo daddy. Why you don't go find out who he is?"

Hampton called out to the man, who only waved him to come up the street to where he was. When Hampton finally caught up
to the man, he put his arm over Hampton's shoulder, and, with gin-soaked breath, said "What he did to yo daddy weren't
right."

"Who? What who did?"

"Son, yo Uncle Claude, he ain't straight. You mark my words, it was him that did in ole Will. He poisoned his drugs."

"Watchoo sayin'?"

But at that very moment, the man was overwhelmed by the urge to vomit up the night's drinking onto the sidewalk. Hampton
backed away in disgust. The man slumped down with his back against a lamp post, and passed out.

Hampton walked back to where Hiram was standing outside the entrance to the bar. He asked, "They smokin' some weed up top?"

Hiram nodded.

"OK, I gotta take a whiff and do me some thinking. That ole drunk claimed my uncle done killed my daddy."

Hiram shook his head: "Man, you can't believe what some drunk staggering down the street tell you. How he supposed to
know about some damned plot to kill yo daddy?"

"Hiram, there's more shit that goes down in the street than your prof Tollefsen at USC could ever dream up! Come on, let's
get up on the roof."

They passed through the bar to the back stairs leading up to the roof. Hampton asked Frankie to roll another joint. As
he did so, Hampton told them about his encounter. Then they all sat in silence as they smoked.

Finally Hampton got up and turned to look at the others. He told them, 
"Listen, my brothers, don't nobody say nothin' about this shit. I gotta check this out for myself."

Hiram looked like he was about to respond,
but just then an ominous rumble of thunder turned everyone's attention upwards.  With great rapidity, the sky to the
west grew a deeper shade of black, punctuated by brilliant zigzags of lightning. The
crew on the roof scrambled back down into the bar just before a torrential rain engulfed Denmark.
