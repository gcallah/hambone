# Up on the Roof


## 1.

Denmark, South Carolina, is a sleepy hamlet part way between Columbia and Savannah. Only four square miles in area, it
is inhabited by a few thousand souls. The vast majority of them are black folk, but until recently, the king of the
town was a white businessman, Will Shepherd. He owned the town's only real estate agency, as well as its used car
dealership.

But there were rumors, rumors that his real money came from controlling the town's drug supply: mainly weed, coke, and
oxy. So when he died from snorting what was apparently some tainted coke, there were more rumors: maybe he had been
taken out.

Up on the roof of Elsie's Bar on South Magnolia Avenue, seated on folding chairs, Bernie and Frankie are smoking a joint.

Bernie asks, "So you think someone took out ole Will?"

Frankie coughs a little, but manages to squeek out "Sure nuff," without exhaling.

"Who you think did it?"

Finally letting out a cloud of smoke, Frankie says, "Gotta be Forrest's gang. Then been wantin' to move in on Will
for a long time now."

"Those lame-ass mother-fuckers from up in Norway?"

(Yes, it is true: a few miles north of Denmark, South Carolina, there is, in fact, another small town named Norway. And
in between the two lies Sweden, South Carolina.)

"Man, it don't make no sense to underestimate them. That Forrest, he mean."

Bernie, staring up at the low-hanging clouds, asks, "Now wait a second: didn't Will kill Forrest's daddy?

"Yeah, that's what they say... and a whole bunch of Polacks too!"

"What the Polacks doing in Norway?"

"I dunno. Some Polish Mafia shit."

Hearing a noise behind them, they spin around to find Marcus and Hiram opening the door onto the roof.

Marcus shakes his head. "Man, you boys don't ever wanna share, do you?"

Bernie laughs, and after taking a hit, passes the joint to Marcus, who passes it to Hiram after having his share.

Hearing a noise in the street below, Frankie looks over the parapet. "Who dat down there?"

Everyone leans forward. Below them, a middle-aged white man is walking drunkenly past the bar.

"Yo, dat looks like ole Will!"

"Man, you fool, you know we buried Will last month. You was there!"

Hiram shouts down, "Hey old man, where you comin' from? You from around here?"

The man looks up at the four occupants of the roof, but says nothing, then turns away and continues slowly north on the
street.

Hiram makes a puzzled face, and tells the others, "Yo, imma go get Hampton. He gotta check this guy: maybe he a long
lost relative or something."


## 2.

Meanwhile, downstairs in the bar, Will's brother, Claude, is having a party celebrating his engagement to Will's widow,
Gertie. Among the dozen people seated at the long table is Will's son Hampton, looking decidely unfestive.

Claude is addressing the whole table:

"It looks like Forrest might be planning a takeover of some new turf. And he ain't sure, but he suspects that it was Will
that killed his pappy. So we gotta be ready for some action from them.

"In the meantime, I'm a send Corny and Clarence up to Norway to see if they can talk some sense into Forrest."

Claude looks over at a young, dreadlock bearing black man at the other end of the table.

"So Ambrose, I hear you plan on headin' back down Louisiana?"

"Yes sir. Plenty work on them oil rigs."

"And what yo daddy say about this?"

Ambrose's father, Winthrop, seated next to his boy, speaks up: "Yeah, I don't like it, but he talk me into it. So I
guess it's fine."

Claude next turns to the white youth sitting directly across from him.

"Hampton, you know you like a son to me. And we gonna need you if Forrest is making a move against us. I know you're
still mourning your pappy, but you gotta snap out of it.

Gertie, from her chair next to Claude, joins in. "Yes son, why you seem so down?"

Hampton rises from his chair, offended. "Whachoo mean 'seem'? You think I'm just putting on some show?"

Claude waves his hands back and forth as though blessing the host at a church service.

"Now listen, it only right you mourning your pappy. But boy, enough is enough. You're not the only one who lost his
daddy. You see my daddy anywhere round here? Everyone here gonna lose their daddy sooner or later, if they ain't done so
already. That just the way of things. You upset about that, you gotta take the issue up with our Lord.
And given our situation, we gotta ask you to drop your intent to go back to Georgia, and stick around here for the present."

Hampton, while giving a mock bow, answers, "Your wish is my command."

Claude ignores the sarcasm, and with a big grin, tells Hampton, "Now that makes me real pleased."

Just then, Hiram enters the bar from the back room, and calls Hampton over.

Hampton excuses himself from the table, saying "My boy needs me."

## 3.

Ambrose has left the party table and joined his sister Camellia at a table in the back of the bar.

"So I'm going back to Louisiana. You gonna keep texting me while I gone?"

"You know I gonna."

"And you might not wanna hear this, but I gotta talk to you about Hampton."

"Oh here we go."

"No you listen: you know he just messing with you, right? Ain't no white boy from the Shepherd family gonna get serious
with a black girl from the hired help. Even if he sincere, his family ain't gonna let him follow through."

"So you giving me this advice, but I know you messing around with that white girl who work at the golf club... you think
she serious about you?"

"Aw we just having some fun."

"Yeah, so don't be giving me no advice you ain't gonna follow yourself."

Winthrop has left the main party table and now joins them in the back of the bar. He addresses Ambrose.

"Listen my boy, you gonna be making big money down on them oil rigs. Don't you go losing your head cause you got a few
dollars to spend. I know them Louisiana folks all into their fancy French ways, but you gotta remember where you from."

"Daddy, you ain't got nothing to worry about."

Ambrose gets up from the table. "I gotta go get some rest before I leave. And Camillia, don't you forget what I told you."

Ambrose gets up from the table and walks out of the bar.

Winthrop asks Camellia, "What was it he told you?"

"He told me I oughta back off from Hampton."

"What going on between you and Hampton?"

"Daddy, he tell me he really wanna be with me, and not, you know, just get some." 

"And you believe him?"

[TBW]


## 4.

As Hiram and Hampton walk away from the party table, Hiram asks, "Ain't it kind of weird, your uncle gettin' engaged to
your mom so soon after your daddy died?"

Hampton shrugs. "Hey, it's just a cost savin' measure."

"Whachoo mean?"

"There's still a bunch of liquor and blow left over from daddy's funeral, so they can save money by usin' it for the
engagement party."

"Man, tThat cold."

Hiram brings Hampton out of the bar, and points up the street.

"Man, that dude look like yo daddy. Why you don't go find out who he is?"

Hampton calls the drunk, who only waves him to come. When Hampton finally catches up to the man, he puts his arm over
Hampton's shoulder, and, with gin-soaked breath, says "What he did to yo daddy weren't right."

"Who? What who did?"

"Son, yo Uncle Claude, he ain't straight. You mark my words, it was him that did in ole Will."

"Watchoo sayin'?"

But at that very moment, the man was overwhelmed by the urge to vomit up the night's drinking onto the sidewalk. Hampton
backs away in disgust. The man slumps down with his back against an electric pole, and passes out.

Hampton walks back to where Hiram is standing outside the entrance to the bar. He asks, "They smokin' some weed up top?"

Hiram nods.

"OK, I gotta take a whiff and do me some thinking. That ole drunk claims my uncle done killed my daddy."

Hiram shakes his head: "Man, you can't believe what some drunk staggering down the street tell you. How he supposed to
know about some damned plot to kill yo daddy?"

"Hiram, there's more shit that goes down in the street than all your profs at USC could ever dream up! Come on, let's
get up to the roof."

They pass through the bar to the back stairs leading up to the roof. Hampton asks them to roll another joint, and they
all sit in silence as they smoke.

Finally Hampton gets up and turns to look at the others. He tells them, 
"Listen, my brothers, don't nobody say nothin' about this shit. I gotta check this out for myself."
