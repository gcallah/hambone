# Up on the Roof


On the roof of Elsie's Bar in Denmark, SC.

Bernie and Frankie are smoking a spliff on the roof. They discuss the passing of Will Shepherd, who had been known as the
"king of Denmark."

Marcus and Hiram join them. They see a figure meandering drunkenly down the street below who looks like Will Shepherd.

"Yo, dat looks like old Will down there now!"

They call out to him but he won't answer.

Bernie shouts out, "Hey my man, you gonna say something or what?"




Hiram goes downstairs to the bar where Will's brother Claude is having a party celebrating his marriage to Will's widow,
Gertie. Will's son Hambone is there. Marcus calls him up to the roof.


"Man, that dude look like yo daddy. Why don't you call him?"


Hambone calls the drunk, who only waves him to come down.

"What they did to yo daddy weren't right."

"Who? What who did?"

"My brother, yo Uncle Claude, he ain't straight. You mark my words, it was him that did in ole Will."

Hambone goes back up to the roof.

Hiram tells Hambone: "Man, you can't believe what some drunk staggering down the street tell you. How he supposed to
know about some damned conspiracy to kill your daddy?"

"Hiram, there's more shit that goes down in the street than all your profs at USC could ever dream up!"

Hambone: "Listen, mother fuckers, don't nobody say nothin' about this shit. I gotta check this out for myself."
