# IV. What's Goin' On?

## 1.

Sheriff Jim Joyce was a kindly looking and plump black man of about 70.  His rheumy eyes gave one the impression that
they had seen a lot, and had had to overlook much of it. Having taken a look around the dining room, he left it to his
deputy to photograph, and joined Claude and Gertie in the living room.

"So tell me what happened."

"Well me and Gertie was sittin' here in the livin' room, havin' a nightcap, when we heard a crash out in the dinin'
room." Claude paused, and cupped his face with his hand, as though the memory of the events he was describing was hard
to bear.

Joyce encouraged him. "Go on. "

"Well, you know there been these robberies around town these past few weeks. And you know how Miss Gladys done got shot
when she confronted the burglar."

Joyce nodded.

"So I was in no mood to take a chance that the same thing gonna happen to me or my Gertie here. I grabbed the gun I knew
Gertie kept in that there side table, and crept across the way to the dining room. It was dark, and the moon was comin'
in the window, so all I could see was a dark shape. And I figured I better shoot before he does. And that's about all
there is to it."

"Claude, that all seems straightforward enough. I know Winthrop was your boy, and you wouldn't have no reason to kill
him. But what the hell was he doin' climbing in the window here at night?"

"That I couldn't rightly tell ya. I been puzzlin' over it myself."

"Well, we gonna have to have an investigation, like with any shooting death. But I imagine in this case it just gonna be
a formality."

Claude said, "I know you'll take good care of this, Jim."

The two of them shook hands at the door. Claude added, "Don't forget to stop by the farm and pick up some collards and mustard greens."

"Thank you. You know I do appreciate how kindly you and your family always done treated me."

With that Sheriff Joyce walked across the porch and out into the cool and breezy February night.

Claude close the door behind him, took out his cell phone, and called Thaddeus. "You and Alastair meet me at Elsie's.
Vite vite." (Claude, a Clemson man, liked to show off what little he remembered of his four semesters of French.)

He walked over to Gertie and gave her a hug. "Don't you worry none now baby, I'm taking care of everything." Then he
followed Joyce out into the darkness.

## 2.

As it was Saturday night, two women were working the bar at Elsie's. Agnes Day was bartending, while Donna Nobis bussed
the tables and washed glasses. Both were zaftig, cheerful black women in their early 40s. And both greeted Claude, their
new boss, effusively when he walked in.

At the bar, he asked Agnes for a double whiskey on the rocks. Once he was served his drink, he went to the back of the
bar, where the crowd was thin, and sat at an empty table.

A few minutes later, Thaddeus and Alastair walked in together. Claude had been watching the door, and waved them over as
soon as they entered. He rose and shook their hands, and indicated that they should sit. Then he called out, "Donna
honey, get us three more of these whiskeys."

Once the drinks arrived, and Thaddeus and Alastair had time to take a couple of sips, Claude, after first looking around the table, addressed them in a low voice.

"Hampton, he outta control. Tonight, he done shot ole Winthrop dead."

Thaddeus and Alastair stared at him in disbelief.

After a moment of silence, Thaddeus asked, "Why he do that?"

"Boys, this can't leave this room, but I think he was gunnin' for me."

Alastair shook his head like he was trying to shake off a horse fly. "OK, but why would he do *that*?"

"Why? Why the boy be jealous then I'm gonna run the family businesses. He think that since Will was his daddy, it only
natural that he be put in charge. But the boy, too young, too inexperienced, and way too reckless. Him being in charge
would be the ruin of alla us."

Claude paused, and looked meaningfully at Thaddeus and Alastair. Once he judged that they had absorbed the first part of his pitch, he continued.

"And now he running around recklessly killin' folk, and actin' crazy out in public. He be bringin' police attention and
dishonor to the whole family, and you know, when I say that, I include the two of you as bein' as good as kin."

Thaddeus and Alastair nodded to indicate their appreciation of what Claude was saying.

"Y'all know, I love the boy like he were my own son, but comes a time when a body gotta cut off a cancer to save the rest of the body."

Thadeus asked, "So what you want us to do?"

"Imma take the rap for shooting Winthrop. I already told sheriff Joyce it was me who done it, cause I thought he was
that burglar who been operating round here of late. But I told Hampton since he's known to have been disputing with
Winthrop, he better get out of town. I told him you two would put him up at Clemson for a couple of weeks, until the
investigation was finished."

Alastair said, "Yeah, we could do that."

Claude shook his head. "But that ain't gonna solve our problem. Unfortunately, behavin' the way he is, the boy gotta go."

Thaddeus's eyes shot open wide, and he said, "But he's our friend!"

"I know, and he my nephew, and we all love him. But like I said, sometimes a part gotta be sacrificed for the good of
the whole. And this here one of those times. Now, is you boys part of this team, or ain't you?"

Both of his interlocutors mumbled that of course they were part of the team.

So here's what you gonna do. You gonna pick up Hampton from his apartment first thing in the morning. He already
expectin' you to be drivin' him up to Clemson. But along the way, you'll be passin' Sumter National Forest. One a you
gonna tell him that you got a school biology project or some such nonsense, and you gotta take some quick samples for
your class project. And it's just gonna be a quick detour."

"Once y'all in the park, head over to Lick Fork Lake. They have a park map at the entrance, so it be easy to find out
where it is. You tell Hampton you gotta take some water samples from there. I got a gun for each of you. You do
what you gotta do, and once it done, you lose both the guns and Hampton into that water. If you weigh him down properly,
ain't likely nobody ever gonna find a body in there unless they decide to drain the whole thing. And then y'all go on up
to Clemson, and go about your studies."

Alastair asked, "And you sure there ain't no alternative?"

"Boys, he already done killed one man. How many more dead you wanna see? Better one more dead than a whole bunch of us goin' to our graves."

Thaddeus and Alastair both nodded.

"Thank you boys. Believe me, I ain't gonna forget your service. Now let's go on in the back, and I get you what you need."

## 3.

At around seven o'clock the next morning, Thaddeus and Alastair pulled up to the curb below Hampton's apartment, which
was on the second floor of the brick building housing the Neeley Appliance Company. Thaddeus, who was driving, put his
hand on the horn as if he were about to honk.

Alastair said, "Whachoo doin'? It's seven Sunday mornin'; you can't be honkin' your horn. Jes lemme call him."

Hampton sounded sleepy when he answered, and said he would be down in a few minutes. When he arrived at the car, he was
pouring a backpack stuffed to the bursting point.

Thaddeus asked him, "Brother, what you got there?"

Alastair added, "Yeah, it look like you movin' out."

Hampton laughed. "On a trip like this, you never know what you might need, or where you might end up. Be prepared!"

As Thaddeus started the car up, Hampton leaned forward, and in a confidential tone, said, "I just gotta say how much I
do appreciate all you fellas, and my uncle Claude, doin' for me. Why, if a brother didn't know any better, I might start
to think y'all cared about me."

Hampton laughed heartily, to indicate he was just joking around. Thaddeus and Alistair also laughed, but less heartily.

He drove two blocks north on Carolina Highway, and then turned left on the Heritage Highway. They passed the Amtrak
station and were soon out in open countryside. The fields that would host corn and soybeans in the summer were now lying
fallow, but occasionally they would pass a green field full of collards or some other winter green. Other fields held
grazing cows, and every once in a while, behind a high white fence, they saw horses wandering before a stately southern
mansion.

Hampton had been drowsy, staring out the window, but he suddenly became animated. "I ever tell you two about the
three-legged pig I saw?"

Thaddeus looked at Alastair and rolled his eyes a little. "I think we about to hear another of Hampton's tall tales."

"No boys, I'm serious: you ever seen a three-legged pig?"

Alastair replied, "I have to admit I ain't."

"I ain't neither, at least not till that day I was drivin' out this way in my Mustang and I see a farmer standin' in his
field next to this pig that only got three legs. Y'all remember my Mustang?"

Alistair said, "Yeah, a real sweet car, until you wrecked it."

Hampton left. "Let's not mention that. Anyway, back to the pig. Naturally, I wanna find out what up with it. So I pull
my car over to the side of the road, and get out. I asked the farmer how he doin', and he tells me he havin' a blessed
day."

"'You mind if I ask you about your pig there?'"

"'Son, you can ask whatever you wanna ask.'"

"'So why it only got three legs?'"

"'This here pig is one special animal. For instance, one day me and my missus was workin' in one of the upper fields.
Junior somehow got out of the house, and went and fell down that well over yonder. We had no idea, and the boy might've
died down there, but this here pig run up to us where we was workin', squealin' like he was bein' barbecued, until we
followed him down to the well. So he mighta saved junior's life.'"

"'OK,' I says to him, 'but what about...' He ignores me, and goes on about more of his pig's remarkable
accomplishments."

"'Another time we was all sleepin' up in the house, when some bad wirin' caught the place on fire. Well, we mighta all
burned up in there, but this pig came runnin' up the house and threw hisself again and again 'gainst the door till we
woke up and made it out just in time. So that time he probably saved the life of the whole family.'"

"'OK, but what about his missin' leg?'"

"That ole man look at me like I was nuts. 'An animal this special... Why, you can't eat him all at once!'"

Thaddeus and Alastair both groaned. Alastair said, "Hampton, you one messed up dude."

"If I'm messed up, at least I'm with the right fellows."

Thaddeus glanced back at Hampton with a puzzled expression, and said, "Whachoo you mean?"

Hampton laughed. "You two is like vacuum cleaners, right?"

"How we like vacuum cleaners?"

"Whatever garbage come outta Claude's mouth, you two just suck it up, right?"

Alistair stared back at him with a look of distaste. "I have no idea what you talkin' about."

"Boys, I just kiddin' with y'all. I know my words too wicked for yo' innocent ears."

Soon Hampton fell fully asleep, his head resting on his backpack. He slept until they had entered the forest, and
Alastair shook his knee to wake him.

"Brother, time to wakey wake. We almost there."

Hampton yawned and stretched in the back. Thaddeus found an isolated spot on the lake shore, amidst a grove of live oaks
hung with Spanish moss, where he could pull the car off the road and park it at the top of a small rise overlooking the
lake.

Thaddeus turned off the ignition, and said, "If y'all help me get these samples, we can be out of here a lot quicker."

Hampton spoke quietly from the back, saying "OK, but first I gotta say goodbye, my brothers," as he rummaged through his
backpack.

Alastair asked, "Why you sayin' goodbye now?"

"Cause I sendin' you two on a trip to visit Winthrop." With that he lifted his handgun out of the backpack, and shot
both of his friends in the head, sending their brains splattering over the windshield.

He rested for a moment in the backseat, wiping away a couple of tears. He then got out of the car, bringing his backpack
with him, and placed it on the ground against the trunk of one of the live oaks. He then moved around to the driver side
and opened the front door. Gingerly avoiding as much gore as he could, he shifted the car into neutral.

He then walked around to the back, and pushed the car towards the lake. It took off down the slope, and sank away with a
satisfying gulp into the lake's dark waters.

He stripped off his blood-splattered clothes and tied them into a bundle, which he weighed down with some rocks, and
then threw into the lake. He washed any remaining blood off his face and hands, and then pulled clean clothes out of his
backpack and put them on.

He pulled his backpack up onto his shoulders, and, through the dappled light dancing through the loblollies and
sweetgums and hickories and maples, he walked out of the park and back to the main highway.

## 4.

Claude was sitting at his desk in the real estate office on Sunday afternoon. He had grown increasingly agitated, since
his attempts to contact Thaddeus and Alastair had been in vain. He punched Thaddeus's number on his phone one more
time, only to hear it go immediately to voicemail once again.

He got up and began to pace the floor. As he did so the door to the office was flung violently open, and he found
Ambrose staring at him, wild-eyed.

When Ambrose finally spoke, he said, "You killed my daddy?"

"Son, sit down."

"Why I wanna sit down? Instead, why I don't just shoot you?" Ambrose pulled a pistol out of his waistband, and pointed
it at Claude.

"Son, sit down," Claude repeated, more firmly this time. "What happened ain't what you think happened." He held out his
hand to indicate where Ambrose might sit, if he should choose not to shoot him.

Reluctantly, Ambrose sat down, but still kept his pistol pointed at Claude. "So tell me what really happened."

Claude himself had sat back down behind his desk, and reclined his chair back. His hands were folded together over his
rotund stomach, and he rhythmically tapped his index fingers together. He sat like this for some dozen seconds before
speaking.

"It weren't me son. Hampton done it."

"So why am I hearing it was you?"

"We didn't want no family scandal. The police was likely to conclude that, given how your daddy was objecting to Hampton
being with your sister, he done killed him on purpose."

"And you just gonna let him get away with it?"

"No son, pas du tout."

"Paw do too? What the hell that supposed to mean?"

"Not at all. Hampton was becoming a danger to all of us. The boy was completely out of control. But I thought it best we
jes kept it within the family, and took care of things private like. I had a couple of my boys take him for a ride this
morning. Lemme just say he won't be troubling us no more."

Ambrose had ceased to point his pistol at Claude, and had let it drop onto his lap. "Aright then, so long as you done
taken care of it, I guess we straight. Otherwise idda hadda go after him myself."

Claude rose from his seat, and held out his hand to Ambrose. Ambrose got up as well, and took Claude's hand and shook
it, saying "I do appreciate you settin' things right."

Claude said, "I always try to do right by my people. I think you better go see to your sister, 'cause she probably need
you right about now."

Ambrose nodded, released Claude's hand, and turned and left the office.


## 5.

Once Hampton had walked out of the forest, he had begun hitchhiking, making his way towards Columbia. His final ride
dropped him off on Meeting Street in West Columbia, and walked from there across the Gervais Street bridge into Columbia
itself.

After he crossed the bridge, he took out his cell phone and called Hiram. After a couple of rings, he picked up, and
said, "Hampton, what up?"

"I really need your help. I'm in some deep shit. Where you at?"

"I'm at my apartment. Where are you?"

"I'm on Gervais Street. At the corner with Huger."

"You in Columbia?"

"Yeah, I jes got here."

"I'm in Five Points, pretty close to where you at. You walk away from the river up Gervais until you get to Harden. I'll
meet you at the corner there."

Hampton did as he was instructed, and found Hiram waiting for him at the corner. They hugged in greeting, Hiram asked
him, "What's going on?"

"Well, I killed a few people of late."

"You done what?"

"The first one was kinda an accident. I thought I was killing Claude, which woulda been fine, but instead, it were
Winthrop."

"So how you mistake a skinny ole black man for a fat white man?"

"It was dark, and he was creeping through the window at Gertie's house, and I thought it was Claude coming to spy on me
and I figure this is my chance: I could revenge my daddy and say I believed I was just killing an intruder."

"Let's walk down to my place, and you can tell me who else you done killed on the way."

They turned south on Harden and headed towards Five Points.

Hampton continued his tale: "Claude came over, and told me he would take the blame for the shootin', and I had to get
out of town. And this all out of the kindness of his heart, cause he afraid the cops would think I shot Winthrop on
purpose."

Hiram shook his head. "Claude don't do nothin' out of the kindness of his heart, cause his heart ain't got no kindness."

"My thinkin' exactly."

"So why he do it then?"

"He tells me he's gonna have Thad and Al bring me up to Clemson. To be on the safe side, before they pick me up in the
morning, I made sure to stash a pistol in my backpack. Well, when they come to get me, they's all shifty and what not.
Can't look their brother in the eye. So it obvious to me Claude asked them to get rid of me."

"Didn't Claude or Thad or Al think you might figure out their plan?"

"I been acting all crazy, so they probably thought I's too out of it to guess what they was up to."

"My friend, you do realize you killed three people in the last two days? A lot of folk would regard that as a bit
crazy."

"Well, one was kinda an accident, and two was self-defense."

"Look, I ain't putting you on trial. Jes pointin' out some inconvenient facts."

They had reached the corner of Harden and College Street. Hiram pointed ahead, and said, "See that wall with the giant
painting of Bob Marley on it? My apartment is just past that."

They walked for a moment in silence, and then Hiram asked, "So what you gonna do?"

"Can I lay low at your place for a couple of days?"

"Sure: then what?"

"Maybe Wednesday afternoon, you can bring me back down to Denmark?"

"And then what? You kill a few more folks?"

"No, I just wanna confront Claude at the fellowship dinner, in front of the whole congregation, and get him to admit he
killed my daddy. At least I can save my mama from marryin' him. Then, I don't care what gonna happen to me."

Hiram felt silent until they reached the door to his building. He unlocked it, and then turn to Hampton and said, "I
gonna do what I can to help you, but I wonder if you really thought this through?"

Hampton replied, "Yeah, I wonder the exact same thing."
