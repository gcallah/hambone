# IV. What's Goin' On?

## 1.

Sheriff Jim Joyce was a kindly looking and plump black man of about 70.  His rheumy eyes gave one the impression that
they had seen a lot, and had had to overlook much of it. Having taken a look around the dining room, he left it to his
deputy to photograph, and joined Claude and Gertie in the living room.

"So tell me what happened."

"Well me and Gertie was sittin' here in the livin' room, havin' a nightcap, when we heard a crash out in the dinin'
room." Claude paused, and cupped his face with his hand, as though the memory of the events he was describing was hard
to bear.

Joyce encouraged him. "Go on. "

"Well, you know there been these robberies around town these past few weeks. And you know how Miss Gladys done got shot
when she confronted the burglar."

Joyce nodded.

"So I was in no mood to take a chance that the same thing gonna happen to me or my Gertie here. I grabbed the gun I knew
Gertie kept in that there side table, and crept across the way to the dining room. It was dark, and the moon was comin'
in the window, so all I could see was a dark shape. And I figured I better shoot before he does. And that's about all
there is to it."

"Claude, that all seems straightforward enough. I know Winthrop was your boy, and you wouldn't have no reason to kill
him. But what the hell was he doin' climbing in the window here at night?"

"That I couldn't rightly tell ya. I been puzzlin' over it myself."

"Well, we gonna have to have an investigation, like with any shooting death. But I imagine in this case it just gonna be
a formality."

Claude said, "I know you'll take good care of this, Jim."

The two of them shook hands at the door. Claude added, "Don't forget to stop by the farm and pick up some collards and mustard greens."

"Thank you. You know I do appreciate how kindly you and your family always done treated me."

With that Sheriff Joyce walked across the porch and out into the cool and breezy February night.

Claude close the door behind him, took out his cell phone, and called Thaddeus. "You and Alastair meet me at Elsie's. Vite vite."

He walked over to Gertie and gave her a hug. "Don't you worry none now baby, I'm taking care of everything." Then he
followed Joyce out into the darkness.

As it was Saturday night, two women were working the bar at Elsie's. Agnes Day was bartending, while Donna Nobis bussed
the tables and washed glasses. Both were zaftig, cheerful black women in their early 40s. And both greeted Claude, their
new boss, effusively when he walked in.

At the bar, he asked Agnes for a double whiskey on the rocks. Once he was served his drink, he went to the back of the
bar, where the crowd was thin, and sat at an empty table.

A few minutes later, Thaddeus and Alastair walked in together. Claude had been watching the door, and waved them over as
soon as they entered. He rose and shook their hands, and indicated that they should sit. Then he called out, "Donna
honey, get us three more of these whiskeys."

Once the drinks arrived, and Thaddeus and Alastair had time to take a couple of sips, Claude, after first looking around the table, addressed them in a low voice.

"Hampton, he outta control. Tonight, he done shot ole Winthrop dead."

Thaddeus and Alastair stared at him in disbelief.

After a moment of silence, Thaddeus asked, "Why he do that?"

"Boys, this can't leave this room, but I think he was gunnin' for me."

Alastair shook his head like he was trying to shake off a horse fly. "OK, but why would he do *that*?"

"Why? Why the boy be jealous then I'm gonna run the family businesses. He think that since Will was his daddy, it only
natural that he be put in charge. But the boy, too young, too inexperienced, and way too reckless. Him being in charge
would be the ruin of alla us."

Claude paused, and looked meaningfully at Thaddeus and Alastair. Once he judged that they had absorbed the first part of his pitch, he continued.

"And now he running around recklessly killin' folk, and actin' crazy out in public. He be bringin' police attention and
dishonor to the whole family, and you know, when I say that, I include the two of you as bein' as good as kin."

Thaddeus and Alastair nodded to indicate their appreciation of what Claude was saying.

"Y'all know, I love the boy like he were my own son, but comes a time when a body gotta cut off a cancer to save the rest of the body."

Thadeus asked, "So what you want us to do?"

"Imma take the rap for shooting Winthrop. I already told sheriff Joyce it was me who done it, cause I thought he was
that burglar who been operating round here of late. But I told Hampton since he's known to have been disputing with
Winthrop, he better get out of town. I told him you two would put him up at Clemson for a couple of weeks, until the
investigation was finished."

Alastair said, "Yeah, we could do that."

Claude shook his head. "But that ain't gonna solve our problem. Unfortunately, behavin' the way he is, the boy gotta go."

Thaddeus's eyes shot open wide, and he said, "But he's our friend!"

"I know, and he my nephew, and we all love him. But like I said, sometimes a part gotta be sacrificed for the good of
the whole. And this here one of those times. Now, is you boys part of this team, or ain't you?"

Both of his interlocutors mumbled that of course they were part of the team.

So here's what you gonna do. You gonna pick up Hampton from his apartment first thing in the morning. He already
expectin' you to be drivin' him up to Clemson. But along the way, you'll be passin' Sumter National Forest. One a you
gonna tell him that you got a school biology project or some such nonsense, and you gotta take some quick samples for
your class project. And it's just gonna be a quick detour."

"Once y'all in the park, head over to Lick Fork Lake. They have a park map at the entrance, so it be easy to find out
where it is. You tell Hampton you gotta take some water samples from there. I got a gun for each of you. You do
what you gotta do, and once it done, you lose both the guns and Hampton into that water. If you weigh him down properly,
ain't likely nobody ever gonna find a body in there unless they decide to drain the whole thing. And then y'all go on up
to Clemson, and go about your studies."

Alastair asked, "And you sure there ain't no alternative?"

"Boys, he already done killed one man. How many more dead you wanna see? Better one more dead than a whole bunch of us goin' to our graves."

Thaddeus and Alastair both nodded.

"Thank you boys. Believe me, I ain't gonna forget your service. Now let's go on in the back, and I get you what you need."

3.

At around seven o'clock the next morning, Thaddeus and Alastair pulled up to the curb below Hampton's apartment, which
was on the second floor of the brick building housing the Neeley Appliance Company. Thaddeus, who was driving, put his
hand on the horn as if he were about to honk.

Alastair said, "Whachoo doin'? It's seven Sunday mornin'; you can't be honkin' your horn. Jes lemme call him."

Hampton sounded sleepy when he answered, and said he would be down in a few minutes. When he arrived at the car, he was
pouring a backpack stuffed to the bursting point.

Thaddeus asked him, "Brother, what you got there?"

Alastair added, "Yeah, it look like you movin' out."

Hampton laughed. "On a trip like this, you never know what you might need, or where you might end up. Be prepared!"

As Thaddeus started the car up, Hampton leaned forward, and in a confidential tone, said, "I just gotta say how much I
do appreciate all you fellas, and my uncle Claude, doin' for me. Why, if a brother didn't know any better, I might start
to think y'all cared about me."

Hampton laughed heartily, to indicate he was just joking around. Thaddeus and Alistair also laughed, but less heartily.

He drove two blocks north on Carolina Highway, and then turned left on the Heritage Highway. They passed the Amtrak
station and were soon out in open countryside. The fields that would host corn and soybeans in the summer were now lying
fallow, but occasionally they would pass a green field full of collards or some other winter green. Other fields held
grazing cows, and every once in a while, behind a high white fence, they saw horses wandering before a stately southern
mansion.

Hampton had been drowsy, staring out the window, but he suddenly became animated. "I ever tell you two about the
three-legged pig I saw?"

Thaddeus looked at Alastair and rolled his eyes a little. "I think we about to hear another of Hampton's tall tales."

"No boys, I'm serious: you ever seen a three-legged pig?"

Alastair replied, "I have to admit I ain't."

"I ain't neither, at least not till that day I was drivin' out this way in my Mustang and I see a farmer standin' in his
field next to this pig that only got three legs. Y'all remember my Mustang?"

Alistair said, "Yeah, a real sweet car, until you wrecked it."

Hampton left. "Let's not mention that. Anyway, back to the pig. Naturally, I wanna find out what up with it. So I pull
my car over to the side of the road, and get out. I asked the farmer how he doin', and he tells me he havin' a blessed
day."

"'You mind if I ask you about your pig there?'"

"'Son, you can ask whatever you wanna ask.'"

"'So why it only got three legs?'"

"'This here pig is one special animal. For instance, one day me and my missus was workin' in one of the upper fields.
Junior somehow got out of the house, and went and fell down that well over yonder. We had no idea, and the boy might've
died down there, but this here pig run up to us where we was workin', squealin' like he was bein' barbecued, until we
followed him down to the well. So he mighta saved junior's life.'"

"'OK,' I says to him, 'but what about...' He ignores me, and goes on about more of his pig's remarkable
accomplishments."

"'Another time we was all sleepin' up in the house, when some bad wirin' caught the place on fire. Well, we mighta all
burned up in there, but this pig came runnin' up the house and threw hisself again and again 'gainst the door till we
woke up and made it out just in time. So that time he probably saved the life of the whole family.'"

"'OK, but what about his missin' leg?'"

"That ole man look at me like I was nuts. 'An animal this special... Why, you can't eat him all at once!'"

Thaddeus and Alastair both groaned. Alastair said, "Hampton, you one messed up dude."

"If I'm messed up, at least I'm with the right fellows."

Thaddeus glanced back at Hampton with a puzzled expression, and said, "Whachoo you mean?"

Hampton laughed. "You two is like vacuum cleaners, right?"

"How we like vacuum cleaners?"

"Whatever garbage come outta Claude's mouth, you two just suck it up, right?"

Alistair stared back at him with a look of distaste. "I have no idea what you talkin' about."

"Boys, I just kiddin' with y'all. I know my words too wicked for yo' innocent ears."

Soon Hampton fell fully asleep, his head resting on his backpack. He slept until they had entered the forest, and
Alastair shook his knee to wake him.

"Brother, time to wakey wake. We almost there."

Hampton yawned and stretched in the back. Thaddeus found an isolated spot on the lake shore, amidst a grove of live oaks
hung with Spanish moss, where he could pull the car off the road and park it at the top of a small rise overlooking the
lake.

Thaddeus turned off the ignition, and said, "If y'all help me get these samples, we can be out of here a lot quicker."

Hampton spoke quietly from the back, saying "OK, but first I gotta say goodbye, my brothers," as he rummaged through his
backpack.

Alastair asked, "Why you sayin' goodbye now?"

"Cause I sendin' you two on a trip to visit Winthrop." With that he lifted his handgun out of the backpack, and shot
both of his friends in the head, sending their brains splattering over the windshield.

He rested for a moment in the backseat, wiping away a couple of tears. He then got out of the car, bringing his backpack
with him, and placed it on the ground against the trunk of one of the live oaks. He then moved around to the driver side
and opened the front door. Gingerly avoiding as much gore as he could, he shifted the car into neutral.

He then walked around to the back, and pushed the car towards the lake. It took off down the slope, and sank away with a
satisfying gulp into the lake's dark waters.

He stripped off his blood-splattered clothes and tied them into a bundle, which he weighed down with some rocks, and
then threw into the lake. He washed any remaining blood off his face and hands, and then pulled clean clothes out of his
backpack and put them on.

He pulled his backpack up onto his shoulders, and, through the dappled light dancing through the loblollies and
sweetgums and hickories and maples, he walked out of the park and back to the main highway.
