# The Tears of a Clown

1.

Winthrop is sitting in the rocking chair on his front porch on Butler Street. His daughter Camillia comes walking up to
the porch, looking agitated.

"Daddy, I gotta tell you about what just happened."

"Sit yourself down and tell me what wrong."

"Hampton, he show up at my apartment round six this morning. He look terrible. His eyes all bloodshot, his shirt button
up all wrong, his shoes weren't tied, and he didn't even have no jacket on, despite the cold."

"Say what?"

"And he was all shakin', like maybe he been doin' blow all night. And he just took hold my hand, kneeling down before
me, and he start moaning, sounding like he a dyin' hound. And then after a bit, he get up and run out the door."

"My baby, maybe I got him all wrong. It sound like he all crazy about you, and when I told you ignore him, it done drive
him mad. And maybe I was just jealous. You know, ole folk like me, we done too easily forget about the passion of youth.
Look, what we gotta do is go see Claude, and let him know his nephew in a bad place."

Claude and Gertie meet with Thaddeus and Alastair in the Shepherd Real Estate office.

Claude: "Look, y'all been friends with Hampton for a long time. And he actin' all crazy now. So we gotta figure out what wrong with him."

Gertie: "He talk about y'all all the time, and we know he listen to you. So maybe you can help us out here, and figure
out what going on with him?"

Thaddeus: "Hey, we ready to help you out, however we can."

Alastair: "Yeah, I'm with Thaddeus here!"

Gertie: "We do appreciate you, so please go see him as soon as you can. We gotta know what gone wrong with my boy."
