# II. The Tears of a Clown

## 1.

Winthrop Branch was sitting in his rocking chair on the front porch of his house. It was a small bungalow on Butler
Street. The front yard contained a very large live oak, and the shade it cast made the lawn beneath it scruffy, and in
places the sandy soil was visible. As he rocked he saw Camellia walking up the street. When she stepped up onto the
porch, Winhtrop could see she was agitated.

"Daddy, I gotta tell you about what just happened."

"Sit yourself down and tell me what wrong."

"Hampton, he show up at my apartment round six this morning. He look terrible. His eyes all bloodshot, his shirt button
up all wrong, his shoes weren't tied, and he didn't even have no jacket on, despite the cold."

"Say what?"

"And he was all shakin', like maybe he been doin' blow all night. And he just took hold my hand, kneeling down before
me, and he start moanin', sounding like he a dyin' hound. And then after a bit, he get up and run out the door."

"My baby, maybe I got him all wrong. It sound like he all crazy about you, and when I told you ignore him, it done drive
him mad. And maybe I was just jealous. You know, ole folk like me, we done too easily forget about the passion of youth.
Look, what we gotta do is go see Claude, and let him know his nephew in a bad place."

The Shepherd Real Estate office
was in a storefront across the street from Denmark Hardware. The office was very utilitarian. The walls needed a
new coat of paint and the floor was scuffed up linoleum. The furniture was a couple of old desks that had been bought at a secondhand
store, and one longer "conference" table that could be folded up if needed and brought to a church function for use as a
serving table. 

Claude and Gertie were seated at one side of that table, meeting with Thaddeus Stevens and Alastair McIntyre who sat on the other.
Claude addressed the two young men, saying, "First of all, I want to thank you for taking the trip down from Clemson to help us out.
Y'all been friends with Hampton for a long time. And he actin' all crazy now. So we gotta figure out what wrong with him."

Gertie added, "He talk about y'all all the time, and we know he listen to you. So maybe you can help us out here, and figure
out what goin' on with him?"

Thaddeus held his arms open wide. "Hey, we ready to help you out, however we can."

Alastair said, "Yeah, I'm with Thaddeus here!"

Gertie added, "We do appreciate you, so please go see him as soon as you can. We gotta know what gone wrong with my boy."

Thaddeus and Alastair left the office. They met Winthrop at the door as he entered.

Claude looked up from the table with surprise. "Winnie, what bring you here?"

"You been saying how Hampton been looking mighty upset."

Claude raised his eyebrows. "And?"

"I done figured out what wrong with the boy."

Winthrop paused for dramatic effect, but at that moment, Corny and Clarence, returning from their trip to Norway,
entered the office.

Claude gave Winthrop the stop sign with his hand. "Winnie, you gonna have to wait a minute. These boys bringing me
important news.

"Boys, whachoo learn?"

Clarence stepped forward towards the table. "We ain't got nothing to worry about. Forrest swear he ain't got no
intentions toward Denmark. He *is* looking to expand a bit, but he got his eye turned toward Swansea. He say the Boucher
family up there looking weak, with stupid shit like car jackings and what not getting out of hand. He thinking time to
bring some order to that mess."

Claude told them "Boys, you done a good job. You all come by Elsie's tonight, and the drinks is on me."

Corny and Claude both mumbled their thanks and left.

"All right Winnie, whachoo got for me?"

"Yes sir, well, I mean to get right to the point here. Ain't no sense beating around the bush, and making a whole speech
when a few words will suffice. Rambling on but saying nothing be a foolish waste of time. And y'all busy people so I
surely don't wanna waste your time."

Gertie turned her head at a 45Â° angle and stared at Winthrop. "Right, so maybe you gonna get to the point sometime
today."

"The point is exactly what I'm getting to, and I don't mean to delay getting there one bit longer. Because dealing with
such important folk as y'all, one gotta be brief. And I could go on and on saying nothing with a whole lot of words, but
that ain't my way."

Claude put his head in his hand for a moment, then looked up at Winthrop and said, "So you gonna tell us what up, or you
gonna just keep telling us that you about to tell us what up?"

Winthrop wrung his hands a little, but continued: "Now, I ain't pleased to bring you this news, but the problem with
Hampton's mind be my daughter."

Claude gave Winthrop a puzzled look. "How she the problem?"

"Well, sir, it seem your boy Hampton done fall hard for her. She sent me this text that Hampton sent her... So let me
read it to y'all."

Winthrop took his smartphone out of his pocket and lifted it with a flourish before his face. He cleared his throat, and
began reading:

"You know you like heaven to me, the most beautiful woman I ever seen, and I just wanna lay my head on your ebony
breasts..." 

Gertieasked, "Is there more like that?"

"Yeah, he wrote her some rap lyrics or something:

"My love burns like a flaming star  
Brighter even than the sun at noon  
I ain't lying about what you are  
You're the notes that make my tune"

Claude asked him, "So what she doing about all this?"

"You know I'm loyal to y'all, right?"

"I never doubted it."

"Then you know I didn't treat this as no game of craps or gin rummy. I ain't playing bunco here!"

Gertie made a face like she had just bit into a lemon. "What the hell you talking about Winnie?"

"What I tryin' to say is course I went and talk to her. And I told her to pay him no mind. Cause, you know, the whole
thing don't make no sense. But he apparently takin' her rejection pretty hard, and I do believe that why he actin' so
strange."

Claude looked at Gertie. "You think this possible?"

"Yeah, the boy always got his damn head in the clouds."

"So how we gonna find out for sure?"

Winthrop stroked his grizzled chin for a moment, and then stuck his index finger up in the air. "What about this? You
know Hampton like to go in the bar and get a beer in the afternoon?"

"Yeah, he do."

"Well, what if I have my daughter go in and meet him there, and we can hang out in the back room and see what happen."

Claude nodded. "Yeah, that a plan."

Gertie gestured at the office window. "And speak of the devil."

Hampton was meandering down the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street, earbuds on, singing something to himself.

Winthrop told Claude and Gertie, "Get yoselves in the back office, and I call Hampton in."

Claude said, "Yeah, why not? Come on, Gertie."

Once they were out of the main room, Winthrop got up, opened the door of the office, and called across the street to Hampton.

"Yo Hampton, what up? Come on in and relax for a bit."

Hampton looked quizzical, but nevertheless walked across the street and into the office.

Winthrop told him, "Take a seat, my brother," and sat back down himself.

He looked at Hampton with the most concern he could muster, and asked, "Now you know, I always got your best interest at
heart?"

"Yeah, for a pimp, you alright!"

"A pimp? I ain't no pimp."

"Then I only wish you was honest as a pimp."

"Honest?"

"In this old rotten world, ain't one man in ten thousand be honest."

"True dat."

"Ain't you got a daughter?"

Winthrop's eyes widen, and he nodded.

"Yeah, you know I got a daughter."

"You gotta keep her close at home. Otherwise some gangster come along and knock her up."

The office door opened, and Thaddeus and Alastair re-entered.

Thaddeus said, "Yo, Hampton, we been looking all over town for you."

Alastair looks at Winthrop and said, "Hey Winthrop, we gotta have a word with our boy here. You alright leaving us alone
for a bit?"

"Sure thing." Winhtrop leaned in close to Alastair, whispering, "He gone a bit crazy. But be careful: he crazy like a
fox." He then walked out of the office.

Thaddeus and Alastair remained standing in front of Hampton. He asked them, "What up, my brothers?"

Thaddeus answered, "Yeah, we doing OK. Not too up and not too down."

Alastair added, "We ain't on the top of the world, but we ain't on the bottom neither."

Hampton asked them, "So when it comes to lady luck, y'all all kind of right in the middle?"

Thaddeus and Alastair both laugh, and Alastair answered, "Yeah, that us, stuck right in her privates!"

"So what brings y'all here?"

Thaddeus answered, "We just come to see you, see how you doing."

"Yo, don't give me no bullshit: you was sent for, wasn't you?"

Thaddeus and Alastair both look sheepish. Thaddeus asked, "What you want us to say?"

"I guess you could go on and say anything you want, just so long as it ain't the truth."

Hampton's friends squirmed about uneasily.

"Y'all terrible liars. I know Claude done called you here."

Alastair admitted, "Yeah, he did."

Hampton stood up. "And I'm gonna tell you why. That way, you ain't gotta be betray no pledge you give Claude to not
tell me why y'all here. You here because I ain't been myself of late."

[what a piece!]

Thaddeus shook his head. "Maybe them Spiritual Gospel Singers your uncle hired could cheer you up."

"He hired some gospel singers? My uncle?"

Alastair answered, "Yeah, he hired some big group from up Columbia way, and he havin' them put on a free program tonight,
over at Rome Baptist Church. I think he's trying to get in good with the locals since he took over for your daddy. In
fact, their tour bus got into town just before we got here, and I think their manager is due by the office any minute
now."

As though on command, the door to the office swung open right at that moment, and Norbert Doubleton, the manager of the group, entered the room.

"How y'all doing? My group gonna perform tonight, and I'm looking for Mr. Claude Shepherd. He around?"

Hampton stood up. "Pleased to meet you. I'm Hampton Shepherd. My uncle ain't here at the moment, but I'd like a word. Oh,
and these here are my old friends Thad and Al, down here from all the way up at Clemson to see how I'm doing."

Everyone shook hands with Norbert, and Hampton motioned for him to have a seat.

"Listen, Thad, Al, I'd like to have a word with Mr. Doubleton here kind of in private. So whachoo say we meet up a
little later at Elsie's and grab a beer?"

Thaddeus and Alastair rose from their seats. Thaddeus said, "Sure thing, brother, what time you be there?"

"Probably around 3 o'clock."

"OK, we'll see you then."

They walked out of the office, leaving Hampton and Norbert alone. Hampton leaned forward towards Norbert and, sotto voce,
said "My man, I need you to do me a real big favor. And whatever my uncle is paying you, I'll add that much again if you
can do this for me."

"Now wait just a second, I don't wanna be doing nothing untoward!"

"No, nothing like that at all. All Imma ask you is to add one song tonight, one that I'll write up for you. I
can rehearse it with you right before the program."

"You know, we don't perform no secular music, OK?"

"This is gonna be a Bible-based song. It gonna be about Cain and Abel."

"Well that sounds just fine then. The program start at seven PM tonight -- though of course that seven CPT --
and we gonna be setting up by around six. So you
come by between six and seven, and teach us your song, and we be happy to add it."

"All right Mr. Doubleton, we got us a deal."

Hampton and Norbert both rose from their seats, and shook hands. As they walked out of the office and onto the sunlit sidewalk,
Norbert said, "Tell your uncle Claude we over at the church by six."
